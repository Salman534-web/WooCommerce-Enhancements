    * Show a prominent COD status badge on single product pages and via a shortcode, indicating availability based on product type.
* **Enhanced Checkout Experience:**
    * Implement an urgency message with a customizable countdown timer on the checkout page to encourage prompt completion.
    * Provide a detailed savings breakdown in the cart and checkout totals, showing total regular price, product discount, coupon discount, and total amount saved.
* **Full Admin Panel Control:**
    * A dedicated settings page in the WordPress admin dashboard allows you to easily enable/disable each feature.
    * **Customizable CSS Options:** Control the colors of COD badges, urgency boxes, and discount breakdowns directly from the admin panel with a live preview.
    * **Custom CSS Code Editor:** Add your own arbitrary CSS code directly through the admin panel for advanced styling needs.
